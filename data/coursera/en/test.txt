besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues , the way of teaching is well adapted to on - site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together ; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google ( or stackoverflow or whatever ) really ? ! somehow it seems they just took an on - site course , played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC . they seem not really aware of the fact that on - site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC ( Dr .
