Phone is sim free. If current SIM card fits phone, then contacts should transfer onto it. Yes, its exactly the same as setting up a new device! On iPhone its very simple and you can transfer all of the data off your old device onto this one very easily! Hope this helps! Mobile Reborn Ltd I only know Apple. If it is an apple all you would need to do is put your Apple log in details and everything from your old phone will transfer over. Usually as soon as you do that it’ll ask do you want everything to transfer. You can then pick what you want or just click yes to all. Hope that’s helped?

Owned iPhones since the 3s and got to 6s and had it for 3years until the battery died. I thought of going up a couple of grades but settled on the yellow iPhone 11 64g.

I’ve got wireless headphones and they work perfectly. It’s fast and easy to use. I’d always say buy a case. I bought a rubberised case and a glass screen guard just to protect it.

Blackview phones are so good! This is my second and I love it. I usually have Samsungs but financially this is the better option for me right now!

I'm no expert but, according to Wikipedia, Giffgaff has been an official carrier of Apple devices in its stores since 2014, so should work on iPhones. Also, if the iPhone is fully paid for, no reason why the Giffgaff SIM card could not be used. The iPhone mini uses the mini SIM. As long as giffgaff have a mini SIM (they all do nowadays), there is no reason it wouldn't work. I'm assuming your iPhone was purchased SIM free with no contract? It’s an unlocked phone so should work with any provider. It should do as long as its unlocked, which all new phones should be. Yes it do yes perfectly Yes.

I think most of these electronic devices should have some return policy when purchasing via online ...since for liking something, we need to see those in person.

None of the S21 Range have external memory slots for SD cards its just internal memory. The great news is that while the S21 does not feature an SD Card slot for extra external memory, it does come stock with 128GB of storage, and plenty of secure, and extensive cloud options if you do need any additional space. We hope this helps! ^DB at Samsung Support No card slot Yes####[['external memory', 'Product Configuration#Memory', 'positive'], ['space', 'Product Configuration#Memory', 'positive']]
