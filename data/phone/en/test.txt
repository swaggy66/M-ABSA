Usually go for high spec branded android phones however decided against an upgrade and thought I'd try a cheap throwaway phone as broke my handset. What can I say?

This is certainly not expected behaviour with our Galaxy A52 5G! We would recommend performing a Soft reset by pressing and holding the Volume Down and Power button at the same time until your phone reboots, then check for any software updates through Settings > Software update > Download and install. If the display issue continues, please don't hesitate to contact our Support Team through the 'Support' page on our Samsung UK website. We hope this helps! ^LP at Samsung Support####[['display', 'Screen#General', 'negative']]

I am on different work calls the entire day and the one thing that pisses me off is the seriously flawed proximity sensor. The screen suddenly wakes up in between the calls... and few moments later you realise some app/feature is open from the touch of your face. Battery life is good, not crazy. Charging speed is average. Google phone and contacts app is quite irritaing with no call recording and some complex unpractical features. This is quite a bummer while switching from samsung contacts and dialler app.(super functional) Rest everything is fine and not worth complaining.####[['Battery life', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', 'positive'], ['Charging speed', 'Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', 'neutral'], ['Google phone and contacts app', 'System#Application', 'negative'], ['screen', 'Screen#General', 'negative']]
Seller took their time to ship the item out, despite confirming that they will ship it on the same day I ordered.

I got this model as not only was it not too expensive, but it also had a fairly good amount of space so I can have a few apps for work as well as some personal ones. The battery also lasts quite a while, so much better than my old phone. Putting in the sim card was quick and easy. The only issue which isn't really a big deal - is how big it is compared to my old phone, but once I got familiar with that, it is perfect. Also missing the fingerprint log in function but it is something you can live without.

First of all this is a replacement to my iPhone XR which had many faults. I really like the new iPhone and it works much better than its predecessor. It includes features like live wallpapers and real Haptic Touch and my favourite double camera.

I upgraded from the iPhone 8, and the phone is wonderful.

It compares in the same way a food-mixer compares to a refrigirator (both kitchen appliances). Both the Samsung and the Xiomi are mobile phones. What more do you want and expect. Do some research online or possibly instore. What is your price range? What spec. do you need. What is it's primary use going to be? Is it for gaming, communication, listening to music watching online content? Aer you bothered about named brand. So many different comparisons and only you can make the right choice for you. Not sure on that model but prob better value likely has all same features best phone I've had better than my daughter's samsung A21s####[['phone', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive']]

With 16MP cam captures clear pictures & 64GB ROM to store data, do support dual SIM & SD card slot for extended memory. 2W speaker & NFC support makes one of the best phones & do have many more features to test yet.

Pros: Battery backup is good. Rear Camera is good. Front camera is average. Image processing could be way better. Display clarity is good. Processing is ok for moderate to high end users. Cons: Don't forget to insure the product for screen replacement. Bcoz the display is very fragile. After 8 months of usage, touch screen stopped working unexpectedly while operating the phone. Lags very often if you don't have space left or you have not restarted for a long time. Front camera image processing not that much great. One advice if you are purchasing, extend your warranty by visiting service center or calling call center before it expires####[['Battery backup', 'Battery/Longevity#General', 'positive'], ['Rear Camera', 'Camera#Rear Camera', 'positive'], ['Front camera', 'Camera#Front Camera', 'neutral'], ['Image processing', 'Shooting Functions#General', 'negative'], ['Display clarity', 'Screen#Clarity', 'positive'], ['display', 'Screen#General', 'negative'], ['touch screen', 'Screen#General', 'negative'], ['Lags', 'Signal#Signal General', 'negative'], ['Front camera image processing', 'Shooting Functions#General', 'negative']]

No the iPhone 7 came all complete with battery installed, charger etc, it was 128 GB model and I paid ?210. If it had been refurbished I could not tell 12 months of daily use and battery still shows 100% capacity. Hope this helps The refurbished iPhone 7 that I bought is 4 years old and has a perfectly good battery, so I I saw no reason to replace it. In fact, this replaced an old iPhone 5s, which still had the original battery. If I am not mistaken, Apple say that a battery should be good for 500 charge / discharge cycles When my phone came my battery health was at 100% so I assume they do Hi there, I recently bought a reconditioned iPhone from Amazon which was complete with battery and have never heard of Amazon selling an iPhone without one. Hope this helps. Cheers. Frank. No The phone retains charge easily for a full day although I am not heavy user Yes.

Delivery was acceptable, around 2 days. The parcel arrived in good condition and was directly mailed to the letterbox. The matte finishing of the case really feels great to the touch.

Probably the wrong charger Not sure how to respond TBH ... It's USB C type which can be fitted either way round. Is it possible that you are trying to insert a micro USB lead in ( which is more of a "D" shape) ??####[['charger', 'Product Accessories#Charger', 'negative']]

The phone seems fine to a certain point. The main problem i have is there is no user guide at all. So a lot of the functions on this phone are probably useless as you can't figure out how they work properly. Might sound stupid but not had smart phones long. All other phones I've tried ( 2) there is an online or app to tell you basics . Why not with this. Like the phone but sending back as pointless workout instructions.####[['phone', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['user guide', 'Product Packaging#Instruction Manual', 'negative'], ['online or app to tell you basics', 'System#Application', 'positive']]

I opt to visit their shop to let them do the installation because I don't trust my fat fingers. The lady at the shop did a beautiful job of placing the screen protector and silicone cover on my S10e. Note that the $65 installation package is actually exclusive of the whole box with UV light.####[]
