Bought this as a quick buy for my son the day he smashed his Huawei. Didn't want to buy anything too expensive for the same above reason. He is very happy with it. The resolution is amazing and it's super fast. The screen size is a perfect fit in the palm of the hand but he uses it popsocket for a better grip. Memory is huge which is a benefit too. Phone screen protection is on already and phone case cover is also included.

I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now.

Title: Best for school work Review: My main requirements from a phone were: 1. Big battery 2. Bright colorful display 3. Good performance 4. Affordable price The C11 2021 gave me the best choice in all of these at the price i wanted, the 5000mAh battery lasts for days, in fact i think it is realme phones OS and battery features that are the reason for this long life. The Charging on this is also good enough, and since the battery is so big i don't need to charge so many times, just one charge can lasts for many days sometimes. The display is also one of the biggest i ever saw in a phone, it is great for you tube, and to watch movies in Jio app.####[['performance', 'Performance#General', 'positive'], ['display', 'Screen#General', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', 'positive'], ['price', 'Price#Price', 'positive'], ['5000mAh battery', 'Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', 'positive'], ['Charging', 'Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', 'positive'], ["don't need to charge", 'Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', 'positive'], ['display', 'Screen#Size', 'positive'], ['one charge can lasts for many days sometimes', 'Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', 'positive']]

Finding a small smartphone is getting harder and I initially feared this replacement for my much-loathed Sony Xz1 compact would be too large. But it's not. More generally, it's an excellent phone. Fast, plenty of on-board storage, well-designed, feels good in the hand, and has a camera that produces impressive photos. My only real complaint is that I'd like it to have the mre recent and tougher gorilla glass (for which I've deducted a star), but that's a relatively minor quibble. So overall I'm pretty happy.####[['phone', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['storage', 'Product Configuration#Memory', 'positive'], ['hand', 'Appearance Design#Grip Feeling', 'positive'], ['camera', 'Camera#General', 'positive']]

Got this car holder for my car, I've used the arm and not the vent-plug because I wanted it to be more at the same level as the dials, so easy to keep an eye on the GPS.

The arms of the holder are easily adjustable so should fit even very large smartphones with little trouble so this is perfect if you use your satnav a lot in car. Even with a charging cable attached this doesn't make the phone move about so I couldn't be happier highly recommended.####[['tough', 'Product Quality#General', 'positive'], ['recommended', 'Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', 'positive'], ["couldn't be happier", 'Overall#Overall', 'positive']]
Unlike the rest of the case, the bottom side (side with the charging port and speaker holes) is not rigid and will move when you slide your finger against the case. So if you are pulling the phone out from your pocket, the case will actually part from the phone if you are catching on from the bottom####[['case', 'Product Accessories#Phone Cases', 'negative']]

The seller promised good battery life. The reality is less than 20 hrs, without using the phone, ie in standby. My last phone, an Aldi rugged using an older version of the same software, would go 3 weeks between charges, and was only retired after 5 years as the battery bulged. I expected about a week from a charge on the Alcatel, given that the battery is 400mAh compared to the 1700mAh of the Aldi phone. The seller description does promote long battery life.

Hello, Thank you for your message. We are selling our phones with battery health at least 85 percent and above. Kind regards, Beata from Gadget Store It was , it wasn’t 100% but came up as 90% and hold the battery life really well for a reconditioned one. The battery is good, after a full day, with average use, battery has approx 80-85% left They vary but are supposed to be better than 80%. Mine was on 95% and in excellent condition. The phone I received had a battery capacity of 85% which initially disappointed me. However it holds its charge very well and so far has retained its capacity.Hope this proves helpful. 80% battery health 90% I believe normally above 85% Hi I don’t know the percentage but from a full charge it lasts me 4days Hope this helps 100% had no bother with it####[['battery health', 'Battery/Longevity#General', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Battery/Longevity#General', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', 'positive'], ['lasts', 'Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', 'positive'], ['battery capacity of 85%', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', 'negative'], ['95% and in excellent condition', 'Battery/Longevity#General', 'positive']]

I am clumsy clutz so used to drop my phones a lot and average age of a mobile in my hand was about 1 to 2 year max. So i always used to go for cheap chinese phones than high end expensive phones as i do know i will be replacing them in a year . So Blackview with its robust build appealed to me but i am not satisfied with the performance of the phone. My cheaper chinese phones used to give better user experience and performance[ at lower cost,by 100 GBP] But it does what it promises to do i had dropped the phone already and there is no scratch. But i would have been happier with cheaper phone which i would have replaced in a year.[ The sturdy build is not enough to tempt me ]####[['cheap chinese phones', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['performance', 'Performance#General', 'negative'], ['cheaper chinese phones', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['cost', 'Price#Price', 'positive'], ['dropped the phone already', 'Product Quality#Fall Protection', 'positive'], ['sturdy build', 'Appearance Design#Workmanship and Texture', 'negative'], ['cheaper phone', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive']]

Where I live, I have great signal reception. But, go to my daughter's house a few miles away and it's a different story, lack of signal masts. So, it all boils down to how many mobile signal masts are in your area. Reception is great. I've had no problems and where signal is weak, my Wifi kicks in Depends on the carrier. I have an O2 card and a 3 card in my Poco, O2 is brilliant 3 is terrible.####[['signal reception', 'Signal#Signal General', 'positive'], ['Reception', 'Signal#Signal General', 'positive']]

Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a ... load of money with them. But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger. So please spend how much extra? Its like selling a car without tyres It is disgraceful, it should be illegal.####[['the phone without any head phones at all', 'Logistics#Lost and Damaged', 'negative'], ['charger', 'Logistics#Lost and Damaged', 'negative'], ['expensive', 'Price#Price', 'negative']]
This will depend on your phone contract not the phone . Best speak to your service provider . It would probably depend on the SIM card that you have ask your network provider I’m guessing as it’s a mobile phone it can be used in any country. If you message the seller I’m sure they can give you the answer I would think it’s more to do with your sim rather than your phone Hope this helps####[]

No surprises here. If you're a Moto G fan you'll not find anything to surprise you with this phone.

Comes with 12 month warranty for peace of mind.####[['delivery', 'Logistics#Speed', 'positive'], ['Phone turned up', 'Logistics#Lost and Damaged', 'positive'], ['battery health', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', 'positive'], ['12 month warranty', 'After-sales Service#Exchange/Warranty/Return', 'positive']]
Don't buy this. After the Android 11 update the phone doesn't connect to network. Wifi also sparingly. It's worse phone from Nokia ever. You can't register to get your phone replaced.

Excellent camera was the main selling point for me. However, given the price, I've been disappointed with the number of navigation issues and unresponsiveness of the screen relative to the google phone I'd had for the previous two years. Battery life very good, again, what you'd expect at this price level, whilst some of the technology upgrades relative to previous generation clearly add value, i.e. sensitivity of fingerprint reader Durability remains to be seen, but I'm unlikely to stick with Samsung next time around.####[['camera', 'Camera#General', 'positive'], ['screen', 'Screen#General', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', 'positive'], ['unlikely to stick with Samsung next time', 'Buyer Attitude#Repurchase and Churn Tendency', 'negative']]
Was a great phone now slowing down and imperfections are evident. Bluetooth is glitchy, often disconnects and reconnects, but it refuses to connect with my car. Certain apps won't load until you force close them and restart them. 4G issues, having to reboot the phone for certain things to work, It's only with having this phone for a few months have things come out the woodwork. On the positive sides, Screen is great if a little washed out in bright sunlight. Speakers are great, dual stereo, offer impressively loud and clear experience! For the price, it's still a bargain, but could do with latest Android and 2.0 OS####[['Certain apps', 'System#Application', 'negative'], ['loud', 'Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'Screen#General', 'positive'], ['Bluetooth', 'Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['slowing down', 'Performance#Running Speed', 'negative'], ['bargain', 'Price#Price', 'positive']]
Very easy to set up. I have very poor sight in one eye and none in the other but I can just about read the names of people on my phone list, which is very important as I don't like handing my phone to other people to get the name for me. Younger hands needed to get back off to insert sim card and put phone in smart case. Case easy to handle and not slippery. Hopefully it will fulfill all my needs as I have only had it one day! I did find the speech volume very low even on high, luckily I am not deaf. My daughter suggested using it hands free, haven't tried that yet. Love it and would recommend it.

Upgraded from the 7 plus. I was really excited to get the new iPhone as I’ve wanted to upgrade for a while but put off by the price tag. First impression was “oh, that’s it” I expected it to be bigger. It was smaller than my 7 plus, looked more square like an old IPhone 4 but heavier. Straight away, the first thing I noticed was how yellow the screen was so I turned off the auto brightness and messed with a few other setting but was still annoyed by how yellow and dull it looked. I tried taking the same photos with the 12 pro and my 7 plus and actually preferred the colour and quality of my old phone’s photos. I even emailed myself the photos to have on the device to ensure it wasn’t just the yellowness of the screen that made them look bad and it wasn’t. Not impressed at all and not worth the money so I have returned my first ever iPhone.####[['colour', 'Appearance Design#Color', 'positive'], ['quality of my old phone’s photos', 'Shooting Functions#General', 'positive'], ['screen', 'Screen#General', 'negative'], ['bigger', 'Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', 'positive'], ['smaller', 'Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', 'negative'], ['heavier', 'Appearance Design#Weight', 'negative'], ['Not impressed at all and not worth the money', 'Overall#Overall', 'negative']]

This phone is encased in rubber and waterproof, including all ports which have a sort of pop out cover. (The screen is toughened glass according to manufacturers description). Therefore it is great for sailors, ramblers, climbers, gardeners and also those who might be accident-prone due to fine motor control issues (e.g. arthritis, teenagers, dyspraxia). The phone matches the description in the advert, as far as I can tell. The fingerprint reader does not work reliably for me, but the phone actually tells you that it is quite new tech so not to expect high reliability. I do not use the facial recognition reader function so cannot assess it.

Great phone so far upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 12 Pro Max, love everything about the phone, just dislike that the delivery guy tried to get one over on us with the phone. He was delivering the phone a case and a screen protector and he only gave me the screen protector and case and tried to get me to sign it as if he had given me the phone aswell, luckily enough I kicked off and he soon went to his van and got my phone on the passenger seat where it was and eventually give it me, I then signed that I’d received all my items.

This phone is absolutely shocking, it's so slow!! Like a snails pace. Bought this for my daughters birthday which she only opened 2 days ago but because I ordered last month we have gone over the 30 day returns policy. The storage is ridiculously small, put 5 different storage cards in the phone and apparently all 5 were corrupt when they all work perfectly in my Samsung S9. The camera is blurry, the touch sensitivity is touch and go. The facial recognition doesn't work. Takes like 5 years to fully charge even with a fast charger. Would definitely avoid.

When I first bought the phone it was operating well. After 3 months, it started crashing and generally was very slow.Then battery issues started appearing. I fully charged the batter and the other day when woke up it was 30% - 50% down without having used it at all, during the night. Now the phone is overheated very ofter even when I do not run many apps. It is worryingly heated up, so I have to switch it off in order to cool it.Yesterday, during the night the battery went from 90% to 1% without having it used at all and the phone was off in the morning. I am very disappointed from this phone and I consider it very dangerous to carry it with me when overheated.

Very pristine condition. What a gorgeous device it was packed in a nice black box with an AKG Samsung earphones , 15w fast chacger (thank you v much, really appreciated that) the device it self was in a bubble wrap. It arrived a day before the said date delivery on amazon notification. Safely delivered by DPD. The only thing that I noticed are the pre installed app from the previous provider it was in spanish that I deleted and made me think ohh is this from abroad as I live in the UK. I hurriedly check the phone system if its snapdragon . But its exynos . I got no problem with that it is what it is , we all have to live with that who are from Europe .####[['device', 'Overall#Overall', 'positive'], ['box', 'Product Packaging#Packaging Materials', 'positive'], ['exynos', 'System#System General', 'positive'], ['AKG Samsung earphones', 'Product Accessories#Headphones', 'neutral'], ['15w fast chacger', 'Product Accessories#Charger', 'neutral']]

Nice phone! Does everything I need it to do. The camera is great, love the macro function. Was easy to set up and transfer info from my old A6.

Overall it is a good buy. Although I had to return it as its mic has issues over video call. Kids are facing issues while taking online classes. A phone with 20k budget should be tested thoroughly. I had to return the device thinking it was faulty but the second one has the same issue.####[]

After 3 months this should be taken up with the person or company from whom it was purchased; they have to issue a refund or repacement if the device is faulty or not fit for purpose (They then pass it back to who they bought the thing from and so on). This is the Law (Google 'Sale of Goods Act 1979' and see the government guidance). If you encounter any problems or reluctance with the seller ask amazon to act as an intermediary to secure your refund/replacement. Your contract of sale is with the vendor. Likely Amazon in this case. You could contact their customer services or alternatively Xiaomi UK directly via their website.####[['device', 'Overall#Overall', 'negative']]

I can confirm it does have the WIFI Calling feature. I've used it a few times so far without any issues. Yes this phone has Wi-Fi Calling installed. It certainly does, but please be advised that this feature often needs to be activated on your account by your network provider before it appears on the phone, so we would speak to them as well to ask what is required to do this. We hope this helps! ^DB at Samsung Support Yes Yes it does####[]

The phone pouch is too small and barely fits an iPhone 12 in a case. Same story with the key pocket. The straps allow to adjust fit from loose to tight, but a loose fit means discomfort while running, and a tight fit, even though feels much better, causes more sweating by keeping your shirt very tight to the body.####[]

Great phone until the speaker died after 7 months. I contacted Amazon who told me to contact seller who refuses to honour the manufacturers 1 year guarantee blaming, believe it or not, Brexit. Seller says he refuses to deal with customs, even though they are trading as a UK company & is no longer replying to my messages. Sellers like this should be banned from trading on Amazon UK & I will be reporting them as such.
