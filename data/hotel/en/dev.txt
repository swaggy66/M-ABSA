Great value in a good location####[]
If you like bland food, cheap beer and rude Europeans - this is the place for you.11 of us just returned from a week in DR.####[]
While the refurbished lobby , restaurants and bars are still elegant and luxurious , the standard rooms are far more reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room .####[['restaurants and bars', 'facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative']]

The staff is fine but the rooms here are so small as to defy belief .####[['staff', 'service general', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative']]
The staff were all helpful and friendly and overall I would recommend it as a good city hotel , but perhaps more suited to singles / couples than families .####[['staff', 'service general', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive']]
Nice, cozy Very comfortable bed (+), we liked that it is a green hotel.####[]
We arrived in San Francisco after rush hour, easy to find with our Tom-Tom, right on Lombard.####[]

Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience.####[]
Great hotel!####[]
However rooms in older part of hotel need updating .####[['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Even with remodeling going on , our stay at the Bienville House was wonderful !####[['Bienville House', 'hotel general', 'positive']]
Absolutely Fabulous!####[]
2nd . the hotel was fully booked for regular rooms , so when i checked in i was upgraded to an executive floor , just for the room , not for the service . the hotel is just above a big shopping center with ok food , and a subway station which isn ' t the most convenient , but it will do . the room was clean , the service was ok , but definitely not something to write about either way , if you need a good hotel in HK , and Mongkok is your region take it , but only if they give a good price , i wanted to extend my stay but they gave me a ridiculous offer####[['hotel', 'service general', 'positive'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive']]

Room typical smallish European , but we didn ' t go to Berlin to stay in the hotel !####[['Room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative']]
I should have been better about writing down all of the cancellation info , because a month later , they charged me for the room I didn ' t even stay in , and refuse to refund my money .####[['NULL', 'service general', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'service general', 'negative']]
I had friends staying in one of the suites and that was great, so if you want a bit more of a treat for an extra 30 euros book one of those.####[]
This place does just as it says on the bottle.####[]

The motel is indeed on Lombard Street , which is in fact a section of the 101 , but as we had rooms away from the street we didn ' t have any trouble with the noise .####[['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive']]

Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising.####[]
