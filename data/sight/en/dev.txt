Inputting 100 cubic centimeters and 1 cubic meter yielded different answers because _the inputs were different._One cubic meter equals one million cubic centimeters because we're calculating in the 3rd dimension.

I highly disagree with the resolution of the "notation problem" at 19'13". The problem is well stressed, but ill solved, if a cat ought to be called a cat! A little "mess" indeed is runing around there, in the lecture notation, and confusion is rising with paradox from a rather different cause than the one stressed out, if RIGOUR is to be called RIGOUR!The little "mess" that is at the core of these confusions is simply that, through the change of variables, though f(x,y) = x+y = 2u+v = g(u,v), which are NUMERICAL EQUALITIES and which are NUMERICALY true, nevertheless the functions f and g ARE NOT the same sincef : (x,y) --> f(x,y)=x+y, and g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+v, WHICH IS equivalently written (since variables are "DUMMY VARIABLES") g : (x,y) --> g(x,y) = 2x+y.From this rigourous functional (or algorithmical) way of looking at it,  it's obvious that f and g are DIFFERENT algorithms, that is DIFFERENT functions!With things clarified this way, all confusions, danger, paradox... simply vanish : (df/dx)y = 1, and (dg/du)v=2 No more pb!...More over, be now clearly aware that we can write, with absolute rigour : (dg/du)v = (dg/dx)y, BUT ONLY IF YOU READ THIS IDENTITY IN THE PROPER WAY ONE SHOULD READ IT, THAT IS THROUGH "FUNCTIONS SPIRIT", AND NOT "number spirit". Why that? Because variables in these expressions, ARE AND MUST BE LOOKED AT, AS "DUMMY VARIABLES"! More precisely, what both of these expressions (dg/du)v or (dg/dx)y, trully mean, is simply and unambiguously : DIRIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST VARIABLE (OF THE ORDERED PAIR, OF THE CROSS PRODUCT OF SETS), KEEPING THE SECOND "VARIABLE" CONSTANT. Therefore we could equivalently have written (dg/dk)@  (or any crazy other "names" of variables), if we had defined the function "in such CHART", labeled (k,@),  by :g : (k , @) --> 2k+@THIS is the only way of puting things trully clearly and rigourously, without ever giving rise to any notation confusion or paradox! Simply by calling a function a function, and NOT "a cat a dog", messing around with words and concepts, through rather "physicist" lasy notations wich turns sometime to prove to be "bad" habits. It's in fact a CHAIN RULE MISTAKE that is arising when one misleadingly identify f with g. If one realy wants to differentiate with respect to the same variable, x for instance, keeping y constant, it is possible! But to perform that without any mess and mistake, one SHOULD NOT naively compare  (df/dx)y=1 with (dg/du)/v=2, wich are clearly DIFFERENT (and nothing wrong about it!). But instead, one SHOULD think "functionaly" instead of "numericaly"! That means one has to compute clearly the "CHAINED FUNCTION" G, which is different from g, but which is related to g by the Change of Variable. We thus express, first the change of variable in the PROPER WAY! That is, as the following FUNCTION :C : (x,y) --> C(x,y) = (u,v) = (x, y - x)We thus recall that the FUNCTION g is defined as the following algorithm :g : (@,#) --> 2@ +#,or equivalently (since what any function trully IS, IS it's defining ALGORITHM!), but more conveniently (for our CHAINING FUNCTIONS GOAL)  :g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+vThese two FUNCTION are now wisely CHAINED to build the FUNCTION G defined as follow :G(x,y) = g(u,v) = g( (u,v) ) = g(C(x,y)) = (goC)( (x,y) ) = (goC)(x,y)We now clearly see what is this FUNCTION G : THE CHAINED FUNCTION OF g and C :G = goCThe central "o" meaning the CHAINING (COMPOSITION) OPERATION ON FUNCTIONAL SPACE, defined, in general, for any two function A : E--> F, and B : F --> G, very simply as :BoA : E --> G , x --> BoA(x) = B(A(x))Which could thus, aternatively be named "THE BOA RULE" instead of the usual "fog" and "gof" of "FUNCTION CHAINING"... (joke!)In our exemple we then get, finaly, since u=x and v=y-x :G(x,y) = (goC)(x,y)  = g(C(x,y)) = g( (u,v) ) =  g(u,v) = g(x, y-x) = 2x + (y-x) = x +ySO WE "DISCOVER" THAT for all x and all y, we have :G(x,y) = f(x,y)That means FUNCTIONAL EQUALITY :G=fSo what have we done? Turning around? Yes, in a sens, because we have INSISTED in differentiating g with respect to x, IN A NUMERICAL SENS, instead of doing it in a FUNCTIONAL PROPER WAY that is, differentiating with respect to its FIRST variable in the ALGORITHM g : (@,#) --> g(@,#) = 2@ + #Thus, in this NUMERICAL SENS, x is no longer a DUMMY VARIABLE, but a "NUMBER ATTACHED TO f"! The physicist would call it a "physical observable". This way of looking at things makes it complicate and cand lead to confusions if one doesn't clearly understand the CHAIN FUNCTION KEY AND THE IN FACT THE MANIFOLD CHARTS MAPPING (THUS CHANGE OF CHARTS TRANSFORMATIONS, often differentiable for a regular manifold) laying under all this...  We thus have, in a sens, "turned around", leading to G=f! But doing so we nevertheless HAVE CLEARLY WRITEN THINGS IN CHAIN FUNCTION PROPER WAY, that reveal to be EXTREMELY USEFULL in higher and more abstract DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY, where crucial concepts of COVERING and UNIVERSAL COVERING, TANGENT SPACE, GROUP, LIE ALGEBRA, LIE DERIVATIVE, COVARIANT DERIVATIVE, CONNEXIONS, DIFFERENTIAL FORMS,..for instance, are usefully springing, needing CHAINING FUNCTION PROCESS to be clearly understood and mastered!Finally, often, this abuse of notation which misleadingly sets f=g, will be handled without damage by the "human computer", with some habits and agility. BUT only in rather easy area. On the contrary it will lead to catastrophic confusions, misconceptions, darmatically false results and chear non sens interpretations, in more suttle area...alike, not for naming them, general relativity, riemanian differential geomedry, condensed matter, plasma, etc...CHAINING FUNCTION OPERATION is one of the most simple, but important one in all mathematics! It's the building block of nested structures, one inside the others alike Pandora box, BUT "BOXES" THAT REVEAL FASCINATING STRUCTURES ALIKE GROUP, ALGEBRA, CLIFFORD,...TOPOS... : PointsFunctions, from points to pointsFunctional (or Operator), from functions to functions, etc...All included IN...CATEGORY Groetendick SPIRIT...deap!####[]

What a gem of a teacher! A legend. I did not learn C of calculus in 5 years of my engineering studies way back in 1974-79. Then came the blessing in disguise and by the way I had to teach some calculus to my daughter in her graduate course in economics. And that is how I landed onto Professor Gilbert Strang's video and I fell in love with calculus which all these years was kind of a terror to me. What a beautiful and stylish way of teaching mathematics. I never have seen any teacher with such a vast knowledge and at the same time  comfortable teaching beginners.

In many linear algebra courses that I have seen, the student is simply told about the various relationships between the fundamental subspaces. But in this course these ideas are convincingly yet accessibly presented. This is very important because it allows students to really understand such key ideas of linear algebra to the point where they become intuitive, instead of simply memorizing properties and formulas. Another great lecture by professor Strang!####[['course', 'Course_General_Feedback', 'POS'], [' professor Strang', 'Instructor', 'POS']]

@[USERNAME]The parabola doesn't matter in terms of bounds because we know it becomes the unit circle in the xy plane. The double integral cares only about the xy plane, and so that's all you need to know in order to set up the integral.####[['parabola', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'NEG']]
What is understanding the concepts he's presenting in comparison to being able to explain them to someone else? It's not nothing, to use a double negative, but you get the idea. It's of course not the only difference between professors and students, but if you can find someone interested enough, try explaining it to them, and you'll never forget the lesson. If you're not a professor, one difficult task is finding someone who's interested, in order to practice. Normally, the way to do this on your own is to write proofs.####[]

At the last proof (A'A is invertible), why is he allowed to multiply both sides by a row vector? Shouldn't that change the solution set?For example, suppose [x1 x2 x3 x4]' = 0. Then x = 0 vector. But if I multiply both sides by [1 -1 0 0], then [1 1 0 0]' becomes a solution.

Think of it this way. Let's say the wheel did not turn but was simply dragged. The curve describing the path of a point on the wheel would be equal to the displacement of the wheel.

In italian calculus courses there are better proofs for limits sinx/x=1 and (cosx-1)/x=0... here the explanation is very confused, and in particular how can I say that the limits would be 1 and 0 and not, for example, 0.99 and 0.01?

How I understood the beginning example about the mean: We defined our sample space to be Omega = { [a,0] , [0,b] }. We defined the distribution over this sample space to be uniform (hence the 1/2). Now each sample can be seen as a random variable which takes on one of the values in Omega. By definition, the expectation is the sum of the products of each outcome with its probability. However, if we define a random variable to be the sum of the samples then we get the expectation of the new random variable is sum of the expectations of each sample. Each sample has the same expectation thus we can reduce the sum to a multiplication by s. PS I don't have very advanced knowledge of probability theory (I'm taking a course right now). If I have made a mistake let me know.####[]
About pi. I find it funny that people say that one can calculate the periphery of a circle but not of an ellipse when the periphery of circle is 2*pi*r and ellipse is 4*a*E(e), where r is the radius of the circle, a is the larger semiaxis of the ellipse and e is the excentricity of the ellipse. pi and E(e) are both as difficult to calculate exactly but somehow people say that the other equation is explicit and the other is not.####[]

The meat starts at 09:56 for those who don't want to waste their time.21:50 I'm not sure if this is correct :p The probability of 0 assigned to each of these points would mean that there is _absolutely no chance_ I hit _any_ of them :P So I wouldn't be allowed to hit anywhere inside that square, and I'm also not allowed to hit outside of it, so I simply am not allowed to throw the dart at all :P What would be correct to say, I think, is that if the precision _approaches_ infinity, the probability _approaches_ 0, but it is not _exactly_ 0, just something arbitrarily close to it.####[]
