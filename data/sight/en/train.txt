Timestamps and Summary for Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem0:00 - Recap of Lecture 2Last lecture: linear operators between normed vector spaces are continuous if and only if they are bounded. The space of bounded operators between two such NVS's itself forms an NVS, under the operator norm. When the target is a Banach space, this space of bounded operators also becomes Banach: this is a way to identify new Banach spaces from existing ones, by considering all bounded operators into them. 0:59 - SubspacesA subspace of a given vector space is internally closed under addition and scaling (linear combinations). Theorem: a subspace W of a Banach space V is itself Banach if and only if it is a closed subspace of V with respect to the metric induced by the norm. Closure amounts to showing that W contains all of its limit points (every convergent sequence in W has its limit in W). We can take any sequence in W; by hypothesis (completeness) it is Cauchy and converges in W. Conversely, if the subspace is closed, we can take a Cauchy sequence in W -- regarding it as a sequence in the ambient Banach space V, it converges to an element in W by closure. This shows every Cauchy sequence in W converges in W, so W is Banach. 5:14 - Quotient SpacesAnother crucial way to form new spaces from old by passing to substructures involves the process of taking quotients. Given a subspace W of V, introduce (and verify) an equivalence relation on vectors in V by identifying two vectors together if their difference lies in W. This allows us to form the quotient set V/W under that equivalence relation; furthermore, it naturally inherits the operations from V and becomes a vector space in its own right. 11:31 - From Seminorms to NormsRecall that a seminorm satisfies homogeneity and the triangle inequality, but not necessarily definiteness -- consider the norm of the derivative of a function; it exhibits the former two properties but resolves to zero on constant functions. Theorem: a seminorm on a vector space descends to a norm on its quotient taken with the subspace of all vectors on which the seminorm is zero. Intuitively: the presence of vectors with seminorm zero represent an "obstruction" of the seminorm from becoming a norm. By collapsing the obstruction in the quotient, we obtain a true norm. 23:11 - Baire Category TheoremA cornerstone of general topology with vital applications in analysis. The version given here states that if a complete metric space can be expressed as the countable union of closed sets, then at least one of the closed sets contains an open ball (eq. has an interior point/nonempty interior). It can be reformulated to state that the countable intersection of open, dense sets in a complete metric space remains dense. (Note: a second result, not as relevant to functional analysis, states that the same holds true for locally compact regular spaces. This is especially important in the study of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The version proven here requires some form of the Axiom of Choice; over ZF it turns out equivalent to a weaker form of Choice that is sufficient to build up most of real analysis). 50:39 - The Uniform Boundedness TheoremOur first major functional analysis result: it states that a sequence of pointwise-bounded operators on a Banach space is also bounded uniformly. More precisely, a sequence of linear operators from a Banach space to a normed vector space is bounded uniformly in the operator norm as soon as each individual operator is bounded. By showing that each of these operators have bounds that might vary with each point, this theorem claims that a bound can be chosen for all operators in the sequence that is independent of the point, and can be applied globally.####[]

For the last part, why is it (right - left)? It is because the Method 2, setting the limit section on y-axis and evaluating the change of x-axis. That means (y+2)-(y^2) = dx.   From the x-axis perspective, the x value from straight line (x=y+2) is definitely greater than the  x value from Arc BC (x=y^2). Or you can just simply draw a line e.g. y=1(horizontal line).  You will know the x value from straight line> x value from Arc BC####[]

Iâm confused about how he explained adding a x particular to nullspace will not give a subspace. I think it this way. Nullspace should always contain the origin, so in this case it is a plane going through the origin, since x particular is a vector not in that plane, adding them together will never give a zero, so it is not a subspace.####[]

Fun fact, not mentioned in the video:If the matrix A is singular, then the process is losing information because two linearly independent vectors in the input space could be mapped to the same output vector, making them indistinguishable. When the professor discussed the matrix for ordinary differentiation of a polynomial function, notice that it was singular. This corresponds to the arbitrary constant of integration i.e. information will be lost, so you save it ahead of time via initial conditions so you can reconstruct the input vector.Linear algebra is amazing for this kind of insight.####[]

change the order of integration.  upon doing this you should get limits on outer integral: lower=0, upper=3; limits on inner integral: lower=0, upper=y/3 where the integral is e^(y^2)dxdy.  now you get xe^(y^2) and evaluate that from 0 to y/3 to get y/3e^(y^2)dy.  Now use substitution u=y^2du=2ydy du/2=ydy which gives 1/6e^u for the integrand, limits being 0 and 9, and when evaluated gives 1/6(e^9-1)####[]

Okay, if anyone is like me who is interested in Linear Algebra and not necessarily Differential Equations, but still wants to understand this lecture for the sake of completeness in this course, here is the list of all the Differential Equations theory you need for this lecture and where you can find content to learn it:1. Separable differential equations - Khan Academy - this is for v(t)=exp(Lambda t) v(0)2. 2nd order linear homogeneous equations - Khan Academy - you need this if you want to understand one calculation in the next item on this list (quick to learn anyways)3. Systems of differential equations - MIT OCW 18.03, lectures 24 and 25 - basically does the first example in this lecture, but actually goes through the steps of explaining what is happening, highly recommended to watch both videosAs someone who is unlikely to apply a whole lot of differential equations in the future, I still found this lecture useful to reinforce the properties of Eigenstuff from the previous lecture, also the very last bit of the lecture is very cool####[]

When proving that (1-cosÎ¸)/Î¸ tends to 0 as Î¸ goes to 0 in the geometric interpretation, shouldn't he be using 2Î¸ in place of Î¸, as he duplicated the theta when he mirrored it upon what looks to be the x-axis? Also why does he look to be using what looks to me like sinÎ¸ (the green line that signifies the height of a specific point on the unit circle) when proving that the numerator of the function decreases significantly "faster" than the denomonator, as Î¸ should be the length of the arc from 0 to a specific angle on the unit circle?####[['(1-cosÎ¸)/Î¸', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'NEG'], ['sinÎ¸', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'NEG'], ['NULL', 'Instructor', 'NEU'], ['Î¸', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'NEG']]

For 13 minutes (21:00-34:30), Professor Jerison tries to justify (1-cos x)/x goes to zero, without, I think, making the case. While he convinces me that the "1-cosx gap" goes to zero faster than the arc length, he doesn't show that it goes to zero fast enough. For example, if it went to zero 10 times faster than the arc length, the limit would approach 1/10, not zero. I'm comfortable with his argument about (sinx)/x going to 1 and have in fact used that argument to defend the "small angle" approximation in Physics. (Larson 3rd edition, pg. 81 however, gives a rigorous explanation using limiting cases of  triangular areas bounding the section of the circular area swept out by the angle, and then applying the squeeze theorem, (1-cosx)/x is left as an exercise. But once you have the limit of (sinx)/x going to 1, just multiply top and bottom of (1-cosx)/x by (1+cos), the numerator becomes (sinx)^2  and the expression becomes: [(sinx)/x] [(sinx)/(1+cosx)], first factor goes to 1 and the second to zero. It's good to review properties of limits for this.Where fault can be found, the good is often ignored. MIT and the professors involved are doing a GREAT public service by constructing these online courses. I'm amazed at the breadth and complexity of the courses offered. I deeply thank all of the MIT people involved in this. The examples and problems done in the class are excellent. I find many of the proofs easier to follow than in some texts.

Love his lectures but I think there's a little mistake in there, correct me if I'm wrong. Professor Strang said {(1,1,2),(2,2,5),(3,3,8)} makes a basis for R^3, but can't that set of vectors only produce vectors where x1 and x2 are equal? So you cant get (1,0,0) from the vectors and certainly not the entirety of R^3, right? The first and second row would even be the exact same written as a Matrix, so they should be linearly dependent for that reason as well. Again, maybe I'm overlooking something but it doesn't add up for me.Edit: Should have sorted comments by new first, it seems a lot of people saw this too but it didn't make it to the top comments####[['lectures', 'Course_General_Feedback', 'POS'], ['Professor Strang ', 'Instructor', 'POS']]

21:47 those blackboards are very nice actually.I also watched the Stanford physics lectures (by professor Leonard Susskind), and they also have very nice blackboards (whiteboards actually).I found that top universities always have excellent blackboards, because those good professors always prefer to do the demonstrations and calculations by themselves on the board.My uni was very mediocre and so were the teachers. after a whole semester they seldom wrote anything on the board, all they do isÂ repeating what's on the textbook and playing the powerpoint with most calculations and results already written on it, One exception was my Mathematical Physics professor, he was a brilliant guy and he always do the demonstrations on the board, and during classes we can often hear him complain about the size of the board and the poor quality of the chalk :)####[]

I used this to self-learn Vector calculus in my summer finishing year-1 of basic Multi-Calc in college starting from Lesson-15 to Lesson-29. I also made use of Schaum's Vector Analysis for problems and SJ Colley's Vector Calc as an additional reference. I watched all vids in at min 1.25x finishing it up in 2 weeks time.Â Dennis Auroux is an absolutely delight and his board-rubbing skills are sooo impressive! His explanations are spectacular & I really enjoyed his emphasis on applications (particularly from physics-inertia, maxwell's eqns etc).One thing I missed was lack of info on the Frenet-Serret Equations which I found awesome in general & the lack of practicing more problems but hey, you could do both on your own like I did!Anyways, 12 years after this vid has been released, I'd still recommend this course with all my heart.

hmmm... this is interesting.I never had it in school that you cannot integrate the function exp(-x^2) analytically .And then I solved some similar integral, of  exp(-x^3/3)... and got an answer and wondered why everybody told me this cannot be solved. Nope. You actually can.  Here is the solution of  the integral of exp(-x^2) :https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral+of+exp%28-t%5E2%29+from+-inf+to+xthe integral is 1/2*sqrt(pi)*(erf(x)+1)which you actually can get by yourself also with the definition of incomplete gamma functions and integration by parts. You just have to know the incomplete gamma functions. and substitute -x^2 by -t. If you do that you get and integral that is almost the very definition of the incomplete gamma function. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_functionIt seems you have to be precise what you mean with analytic. analytic is all trigonometric functions and exp plus some sqrt and all their possible combinations....Gamma functions and all kind of other integrals not included.So no need to integrate this one numerically if you have incgamma or erf at hand. And I guess there is a reason why you call it error function. And neither do you need tables anymoreThis is one example where analytic math has sort of stopped before the incomplete gamma funciton and other integral defined functions and a like have been invented. I guess this is actually a case where people would vigorously disagree just because they learned it otherwise without defining precisely what means actually analytic in this case.I always wondered why on earth people think it until I came across this video by a german prof actually shading a little light on it. It seems this is only due to the historic definition of analytichttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6w868U8C-Mhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(differential_algebra) For an enghineer I would say this statement doesnt really make sense. Anyhow calculating gammas and gammainc functions, also hypergeometric functions is another story in itself, especially when multiplying special functions like exp and erf with each other to get them, that much I remember from calculating something also called F1.Anyway... incomplete gamma functions are already seriously cool. Since you can calculate them within standard math libraries and they are the general case of many other special funcitons like error function, exponential integral, I think even airy. For many solutions of variable coefficient second order odes it was useful in many cases. And wolfram alpha knows how to handle it pretty well ^ (try for example integral of exp(-1/3*x^3))####[]

The proof at the end starts off with: f(x) x->a = f(a) - the definition of continuous. So f(x) x->a - f(a)=0. Then simplifies to f'(a)*0, this however only holds if a function is continuous. If a function was not continuous then it would simplify to f'(a)*some constant. As f(x) x->a - f(a)=c - is not continuous.Which would make it not = 0. And in order to be differentiable x-a has to go to zero (by definition). That is how differentiable implies continuous.I hope this helps.####[]

High and low are relative terms.

then we basically have a bunch of rectangles. when n approaches infinity, the rectangles width gets infinity small, and the values for f(x) over that interval pretty much become equal, they differ very little. so we can multiple f(x) by the differential dx, the very small width, and get the anti derivtive of each one of the rectangles. the sum then becomes of a bunch of rectangles, and is now the following. [F(n)-F(n-1)] + [F(n-1) - F(n-2)] ...-[F(2) - F(1)]. THEN, the amazing part....####[]

I think this could act as a proof of min 18:15 claims: * for the degenerate case, we have a line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) = 0 for wich z is allways 0 . It acts like the case of z = x^2 but rotated ( because the term affecting  y^2 is zero in the deg. case ).* for the opposite signs (saddle): if we fix y=0 and let x increase we get possitive values but if we move for the line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) =  0  (the same as for the deg case) we get a decrease in the z values. (because y^2 is positive and the term affecting it is negative for saddle point case).For the conditions of the exercise we start moving from (0,0) and the signs from above are in the case ( 1 / 4a ) is possitive (so change if negative). You can plot some functions on Google: e.g copy paste 6*x**2+5*x*y+y**2 and x**2+4*x*y+4*y**2####[]
@[USERNAME]The union is not a subspace. The union is bigger than P or L so it definitely can't be a subspace of either of them. and by adding a vector from P with a vector from U you can get to a point that is neither in P nor in U or in other words by adding two points from PâªL you can get to points outside of PâªL (somewhere in RÂ³). But to form a subspace you have to be able to add any vectors from that subspace and the result has to be in that subspace.####[]

31:59 Basically, the reason why you can solve this problem, you can make a finite automaton which recognizes the language B, is because that finite automaton is going to keep track of the parity of the number of 1'sit's seen before. This has two states, one of them remembering that it's seen an odd number of 1's so far,the other one remembering it's seen an even number of 1's before. And that's going to be typical for these automata,finite automata. There's going to be several different possibilities that you may have to keep track of as you're reading the input, and there's going to be a state associated with each one of those possibilities. So if you're designing an automaton, you have to think about-- as you're processing the input-- what things you have to keep track of. And you're going to make a state for each one of those possibilities41:52 Show finite automata equivalent to Regular Expression.####[]

Reply to a question below on why we care about the 4 fundamental subspaces in the study of Ax=b: In professor Strang words (not in this lecture) "understanding the four fundamental subspaces elevates the understanding of Ax=b to a vector space point of view, specifically, to to a vector subspace level of understanding"It will pay off when learning different types of matrix factorizations, for ex, Single Value decomposition, SVD, where A=UâV^T.  Where U is composed of orthonormal vectors in the row space, V of orthonormal vectors in the Column Space,  â by the diagonal matrix of the squares of the singular values.Similarly,  all other matrix factorizations QR, Q(LAMBDA)Q^T, etc benefit from their description in terms of subspaces.This understanding/insight is super powerful, even critical, in Optimization,Machine Learning,  ill posed problems, etc Plz don't disregard this Vector Subspace approach, it's only apparently that it doesn't seem to shine when being learnt for the first time, but believe me, it's pure gold, and the clarity with which  Professor Strang explains it is invaluable...he said it himself, it bends your mind when extended to sets of matrices, and to sets of functions (the differential equation example, a prelude to Fast Fourier Transform) but the dividends you gain are huge####[['fundamental subspaces', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'POS']]

If A^T A V = V S is the spectral decomposition of A^T A with S diagonal and V orthogonal, we have that (A V)^T (A V)= S. Hence, the nonzero columns of AV, which is associated with the nonzero columns of A, is orthogonal with all other nonzero columns of AV. Hence, is possible to find an orthogonal matrix U such that A V = U sqrt(S) -- note that the diagonal of S give us the squared norm of each column of AV, which means this is completely fine. Now, this means A=U sqrt(S) V^T. Completing U, if necessary, we have the SVD decomposition. In practice, after the calculation of the spectral decomposition of A^T A, we would calculate the Kern of (AV)^T -- orthogonal to Im(AV) -- and find an orthogonal basis to it, and of course, all the singular values associated with this process would be zero.####[]

It may be worth to note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are, and also looking at the networks in a more structured manner thus making clear how the basic ideas of BPP apply to much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 1.- More general processing units. Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 2.- More general layers (any number of units). Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 3.- Networks with any number of layers. A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 4.- Quadratic error of a function. ...ââ-Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism. Daniel Crespin####[]

This might help others trying to learn this material. I found it easiest to watch a few lectures, but without being overly concern about learning exactly whats going on. This gives you a basis to work from.Then get the text book and work though it slowly. Write down the examples in the book as you encounter them and get used to forming a mental picture for whats going on. The column picture is key.The row picture is probably what your school math teacher taught you. This just confused me a lot. I don't like dot products, but the "combinations of columns" is very intuitive once you can visualize why it works. The reason I found this easier is that the concepts introduced in the videos are a bit loose, its just an overview. The real learning comes from the text book.####[]

This is a great lecture, and Prof Jerison seems a very good teacher.However, although I followed and understood this without any problems, this is only because *I am familiar with the notion of integral anyway*, having already covered it in my mathematical education up to this point.If this lecture was my first exposure to this stuff, I think I'd have been pretty confused about what was going on, with the speed that Jerison went and the way in which he introduced the concepts and notations: the integral sign and the dx on the end just suddenly appearing out of nowhere.On the MIT website, it says that no prior knowledge of calculus is required to take this course: although this is technically true, I think I'd struggle if I'd never seen any of this before.####[]

Jerison is only comparing the highest degree terms in both the numerator (1) and the denominator (1/x), because that's all that matters when the limit approaches infinity. And yes, the factor does disappear to zero, after that comparison is made. He's just eliminated the rest of the terms in advance because they're irrelevant when x approaches infinity.####[['Jerison', 'Instructor', 'NEU']]

Look, your product rule argument is circular.  The proof of the product rule "assumes" two things:  1) That the limits exist.  2) that the functions are differentiable (at least around the limits).  Continuity can't be proven, if that is the assumption you are beginning with.####[]

Great lectures (19/20) but same remark than in lect5, there is great confusion between VECTOR SPACE and AFFINE SPACE, and in particular between the AFFINE ORIGINE (0,0,0) and the 0 VECTOR. The 0 vector is NO WHERE. He's NOT living in affine space. Actualy this aparent paradoxes can only be overcome by driling to the heart of the true definition of a vector space. For the 1-dim vector space, they are by serious definition an EQUIVALENT CLASS of infinitely many parrallel affine lines that fill the entire plane. Similarely a 2-dim vestor space is an equivalent class of infinitely many parallel affine planes that fill the entire 3-space R^3. The key word is thus, REPRESENTATION (Vorstellung in German). An affine line is a particular REPRESENTATION, a "minister" of a "King" which give the DIRECTION : the 1-dim VECTOR SPACE. Similarly an affine plane is a particular REPRESENTATION, a minister of a "King&Queen" which fix the TWO-DIRECTION : the 2-dim VECTOR SPACE####[]

"our little matrix" - a Gilbert Strang production####[]
At t = 21:00, Strang covers the definition of inversion (and at 32:00 he gives an example): first suppose A is an n x m matrix. Then if you have a left inverse L that acts on A, it will produce an identity matrix, call it I_n; similarly, If you have a right inverse R, when A acts on R it will also produce an identity matrix, call it I_m. So a Matrix is non-singular (sometimes mistakenly called regular) only if  m = n, A is square, and det(A) (does not) = 0. In particular, if the matrix A have full rank = n, all its columns and rows would be independent, so A would be invertible.####[]

A derivative is the slope of a line.  Like if the line is Y = 2X, the slope is 2, so Y=2 is the derivative of Y=2X.  A limit is basically what the graph looks like it is going to do as it gets closer and closer to the limiting value.####[]

You can find the value 2*y0, when the derivative of 1/x cut the Y exe, by making similar triangles. If the slope reflects a change from y0 to 0 when X changes from x0 to 2*x0 , so it should change from y0 to 2*y0 when X changes from x0 to 0. It's easiest to see in a graph.The notation f' is from Lagrange, not Newton.Â I love MITOCW. Thanks!####[['MITOCW', 'Course_General_Feedback', 'POS']]

The meat begins at 12:00.05:30 Errr, no, the square is not "made of" points. It *contains* those points. A point just marks a certain location inside that (pre-existing) square. One _cannot_ build the area of the square from points, because POINTS DON'T HAVE ANY AREA BY THEMSELVES!!! Areas could be made only from smaller (e.g. unit) areas. Otherwise there would be no difference between a scalar, a vector, a pseudovector, and a pseudoscalar in Clifford Algebras etc. There's a reason we distinguish those dimensions, right? :PThe ridiculousness of that statement comes out nicely at 06:10 where he writes the sum of the probabilities for these points. He said in the previous lecture that the probability of a point is 0 (because it has no area, and we assumed that area = probability in this model), and he restated this assumption again in this lecture here. So we're actually *adding up 0s here*! And we _cannot_ get a positive result (in this case: 1) from summing up zeros, no matter how much of them we add up (be it 10, 100 or infinitely many). So the right side of this equation cannot be equal to the left side, and the entire equation is false.06:40 No, the mistake is not in this point. The union is fine, as long as we're adding up actual areas. The mistake is in assuming that a point can have an area :P07:20 Of course I can! Cantor's diagonalization argument is one example. Another one is Hilbert's space-filling curve. Long story short: yes, there are ways of ordering points on a surface, as well as in space, by threading them on a line. In other words, there exist functions which map points on a surface (or in space) onto a line. And this is another proof that this is not what is wrong with this argument. The "points have area" assumption is.17:20 If the probability of B is 0, then we're contradicting ourselves, because the "|B" in "P(A|B)" was supposed to mean that B occurred *for sure*. So it _cannot_ be 0! The very statement that "B occurred" means that this probability is _not_ 0, and we are OK to put it in the denominator. Logic, Mr. Titskills :P####[]
Thank you. Please we need Organometallic Chemistry .tq####[]
I think there was a bit of misunderstanding with the question a student asked around 17:30. The student asks why the right hand limit must exist. When the instructor wrote down "right hand limit" he didn't mean the limit from the right hand side (x->a+), he literally mean the limit he wrote on the right.Technically, the right hand limit (x->a+) has to exist otherwise the full limit wouldn't exist, but that goes without saying.####[]
