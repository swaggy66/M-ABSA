I must say that I have been very disappointed by this lecture series so far. I am already familiar with single variable calculus. However, I am watching this series to review for some future classes (things like multivariable calculus and real analysis). However, here are some things I have noticed. Would that this instructor had spent some more time on the more rigorous concepts of limits and squeeze theorem, he would not have had to spend so much time trying to justify the proofs of the main two limits of this lecture. In addition to this, his students would be better prepared for future mathematics. As it stands, these students are really at a loss when it comes to their future.I would really hope that instructors learn from this. Spend more time on the things you need to rigorously justify your claim: the foundations. If the ideas are glossed over, then everyone loses. Students don't understand why something is true, and so they become convinced that what the professor is doing is some kind of witchcraft that makes no sense.

The facilities they provide and professors that they are hire are among the best in the world.  Those things are not cheap.They need donations to provide the free education.

This is the best explanation of the projection formula that I have ever seen. Prof. Strang not only provides a mathematical basis of the formula by deriving it, but also provides clear intuition and motivation.

What a great lecture!####[['Prof. Strang', 'Instructor', 'POS'], ['explanation', 'Mathematical_Related_Concept', 'POS']]
Excellent class and excellent lecturer, i think that the guys didnt see the basis of linear algebra thats the reason that prof Auroux gave them an introduction of analitic geometry and elemental algebra, there are assignments that in Mexico are elemental at Facultad de Ingenieria UNAM: algebra(real numbers,  complex numbers, polynomials, ecuation systems and matrices), analytic geometry (polar curves, curves at space, vectorial algebra, surfaces), linear algebra (vectorial spaces, transformations, change of bases, function dependence; linear combinarions and theorems) obviously differential and integral calculus and finally in elemental maths vectorial calculus(multivariable calculus) that is linked to this, but prof Auroux resumed the basis in 2 hours thats awesome####[['class', 'Course_General_Feedback', 'POS'], ['lecturer', 'Instructor', 'POS']]

Honestly I think there should be people moderating the comments section that delete those judgmental comments. The students have rights to learn in a safe environment. Asking “stupid” questions is an integral part of learning as much as making mistakes.

Terrible video. What is an example of  a Hilbert space with real numbers in a actual application.

His teaching style seems casual and intuitive. I go to a small public college and the course is much more formal and proof driven. These lectures are a great addition to (as well as a nice break from)  formal proofs.
