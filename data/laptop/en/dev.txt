this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####[['version', 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', 'negative']]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[['track pad', 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', 'negative']]
should not of bought this chromebook .####[['chromebook', 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', 'negative']]
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####[['screen', 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', 'negative']]
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####[['trackpad', 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', 'negative'], ['keyboard keys', 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', 'negative']]
the keyboard is stiff and unresponsive to my typing at times .####[['keyboard', 'KEYBOARD#QUALITY', 'negative'], ['keyboard', 'KEYBOARD#QUALITY', 'negative']]
the chromebook r 11 was hardly used and only a few months old .####[['chromebook r 11', 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', 'negative']]

overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####[['system', 'OS#PRICE', 'positive'], ['ssd', 'HARD_DISC#PRICE', 'positive']]
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####[['fan', 'FANS&COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', 'negative']]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[['asus', 'COMPANY#GENERAL', 'positive'], ['machines', 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', 'positive']]

the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[['picture clarity', 'DISPLAY#QUALITY', 'positive'], ['backlit keyboard', 'KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES', 'positive']]
